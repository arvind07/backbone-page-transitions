backbone-page-transitions
=========================

Animating between different views in Backbone JS.

This is a small Backbone JS application that shows how we can animate views in Backbone JS. The animation effects have been generated using CSS3.
The advantage of this application is that you need not to change anything in your views to apply the transition effect. This plugin only changes the way the viiews are rendered in the main application. This plugin has a `render` method that will render the views and apply necessary classes for the transition.

Currently the plugin supports two transition effects:
1. slideInOut
2. slideUpDown

How to apply this plugin:
